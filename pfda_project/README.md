Module PROGRAMMING FOR DATA ANALYTICS

by Jennifer Ibanez Cano. Student of Higher Diploma in Science in Computing in Data Analytics at the [ATU Galway](https://www.atu.ie), 2024.

**About this directory**

This directory has all my work related with the big project of the module Programming for Data Analytics. This module has been delivered by Professor [Andre Beatty](https://github.com/andrewbeattycourseware). 

In this directory I performed data analysis on a dataset. For this project I used a data set from [UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/863/maternal+health+risk), that I found very interesting related with the maternal health risk as I became a mom 2 years ago.

All the data analysis can be found in my [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/Jennyicano/PFDA/blob/main/pfda_project/big_project.ipynb). Here I looked into the different variables that can be affecting the maternal health risk in women like:
- age 
- body temperature
- blood pressure



And how these variables can be the result in low, mid and high risk. 

**Getting started**

The tools that I needed to install and then I used in my computer to complete the module tasks and project were the following: 

* [Download Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/success). 
* Install the latest version of [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
* [vs code](https://code.visualstudio.com).
* Sign up in [GitHub Student](https://education.github.com/pack)
